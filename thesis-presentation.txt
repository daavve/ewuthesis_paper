Chinese Calligraphy
Character Segmentation
1 / 35

Segmentation of Chinese
Calligraphy characters is
very difcilt
●

●

●

Commercial grade Optical Character
Recognition(OCR) software performs very
poorly
Tesseract—The leading free OCR tool cannot
detect even a single character in the
Collected Characters.
Academic character detectors perform better,
but quality is inconsistent, and work can be
difcult to duplicate

Objective
●

●

Apply best-in-class academic character
detection methods to “collected character’s”
book.
Necessary components:
–

Feature extraction (SIFT)

–

Classifer ((Deep Learning)
●

Calligraphy training data CA(DAL

●

Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) and
(Deep Learning (>94% accuracy)
SIFT—A method for identifying the most
important parts of an image. Robust against
size and orientation
(Deep Learning—A machine learning
technique utilizing multiple layers of artifcial
neurons.

Challenges with SIFT
●

SIFT is the best performing feature extraction
technique
–

●

SIFT is a patented technology and requires
an expensive license (>$5,000)

Alternative: Glyph-based feature extraction
–

Glyph: A contiguous island of black pixels
surrounded by white pixels

Challenges with Deep
Learning
●

(Deep learning is computationally very
expensive.
–

●

Best performing algorithms require server
farms with exotic hardware

Alternative: Simpler ML technique
–

Support Vector Machine(SVM)

●

Best Method:
–

Features extracted from image (SIFT)

–

Features fed into classifer ((Deep Learning)

My Method
–

Image Binarized (Otsu)

–

Glyphs detected → features extracted

–

Features fed into classifcation flter (SVM)

–

Remaining Glyphs merged into characters

Classifer training
●

Before a classifer can be used it must be
trained against known examples
–

Researchers in China have created a
Chinese CAlligraphy (Dataset Library
(CA(DAL)

–

CA(DAL → interactive website containing
bounding-box data for 110,652 characters

–

Used a web-scraping technique to
download full dataset from CA(DAL website.
