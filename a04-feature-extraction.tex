\chapter{Feature Extraction}

box is part of the character:

1)  If it is inside a box that has a character
2)  If the box is larger than 1 / 20th the area of the parent box,,,,   might change


Differences between detected chars and selected chars:

1) Detected chars are

* Inside char region
 -A part of character
 -The whole character
 --A glyph spanning multiple characters
 --noise that is not part of a character

* Outside char region.
 -noise similar to the noise inside chars
 -marks unrelated to calligraphy like smudges or stamps
 
In order to prep the data for the support vector machine I will probably have to normalize the array size of each image

integer	4 bytes	typical choice for integer	-2147483648 to +2147483647
