\chapter{Conclusion}

This work built a classifier based on data provided by the CADAL Dataset.

The perforamance of this classifier was evaluated,

I demonstrated the usefullness of the classifier by including the classifier as a part of a character detection algorithm, as well as a component detection algorithm.

The classifier performed poorly due to missing data in the CADAL dataset. 



The work also validated the usefullness of the CADAL dataset in building a classifier.

Also that better the quality of data used to train the classifier the better the resulting predictions.  By adding to the completeness of the CADAL I add to the quality of any further research using the CADAL Dataset.
